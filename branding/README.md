If you're using our catalog to create a product or service we would appreciate if you would spread the word about this project.
It's not mandatory, but definitely helps us to grow bigger and the entire API ecosystem will benefit.

Pages which show some info from our catalog could have one of the following links:
 - **Powered by \<LOGO\>**
 - **API specs supplied by \<LOGO\>**

All links should point to http://APIs.guru, at the moment it's **temporarily** redirected to GitHub repo.

You should use only official logos:

| [Logo]| [Horizontal logo]| [Vertical logo]|
|-------|------------------|----------------|
|![Logo]|![Horizontal logo]|![Vertical logo] |

The correct way to write our name is **APIs.guru** with exact this combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.
We recommended using the [Sansation](http://www.dafont.com/sansation.font) font, or simply use the logo with name included.

Please add **"How can I request/add/fix an API?"** section into customer documentation or FAQ.
<BR>**TBD**: Create sample text.
