  title: AWS Transfer Family
  description: 'AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). AWS helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to AWS Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with AWS services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with AWS Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.'

You will need to specify the "<code>Entry</code>" and "<code>Target</code>" pair, where <code>Entry</code> shows how the path is made visible and <code>Target</code> is the actual Amazon S3 path. If you only specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You will need to also make sure that your AWS IAM Role provides access to paths in <code>Target</code>. The following is an example.</p> <p> <code>''[ "/bucket2/documentation", { "Entry": "your-personal-report.pdf", "Target": "/bucket3/customized-reports/${transfer:UserName}.pdf" } ]''</code> </p> <p>In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope-down policy to lock your user down to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set <code>Entry</code> to ''/'' and set <code>Target</code> to the HomeDirectory parameter value.</p> <note> <p>If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3, the entry will be ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 api to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the <code>s3api</code> call instead of <code>s3</code> so you can use the put-object operation. For example, you use the following: <code>aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/</code>. Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a ''/'' for it to be considered a folder.</p> </note>'

          description: '<p>Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You will need to specify the "<code>Entry</code>" and "<code>Target</code>" pair, where <code>Entry</code> shows how the path is made visible and <code>Target</code> is the actual Amazon S3 path. If you only specify a target, it will be displayed as is. You will need to also make sure that your AWS IAM Role provides access to paths in <code>Target</code>. The following is an example.</p> <p> <code>''[ "/bucket2/documentation", { "Entry": "your-personal-report.pdf", "Target": "/bucket3/customized-reports/${transfer:UserName}.pdf" } ]''</code> </p> <p>In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope-down policy to lock your user down to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set <code>Entry</code> to ''/'' and set <code>Target</code> to the HomeDirectory parameter value.</p> <note> <p>If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3, the entry will be ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 api to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the <code>s3api</code> call instead of <code>s3</code> so you can use the put-object operation. For example, you use the following: <code>aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/</code>. Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a / for it to be considered a folder.</p> </note>'
