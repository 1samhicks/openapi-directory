However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents of your message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit content isn''t preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend that you encode all content that isn''t 7-bit ASCII. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-raw.html#send-email-mime-encoding">MIME Encoding</a> in the <i>Amazon SES Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Although you can customize the message headers when using the <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own <code>Message-ID</code> and <code>Date</code> headers; if you passed these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES provides.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, <code>SendRawEmail</code> enables you to specify the cross-account identity for the email''s Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can pass optional parameters <code>SourceArn</code>, <code>FromArn</code>, and/or <code>ReturnPathArn</code> to the API, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>X-SES-SOURCE-ARN</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>X-SES-FROM-ARN</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN</code> </p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>Don''t include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the email.</p> </important> <p>If you only specify the <code>SourceIdentityArn</code> parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you specified.</p> <p>For more information about sending authorization, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html">Using Sending Authorization with Amazon SES</a> in the <i>Amazon SES Developer Guide.</i> </p> </li> <li> <p>For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your <i>sending quota</i>).
