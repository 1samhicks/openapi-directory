  description: '<p>Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. When your resources change state, they automatically send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For example, you can configure rules to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state</p> </li> <li> <p>Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks</p> </li> <li> <p>Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about the features of Amazon EventBridge, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/">Amazon EventBridge User Guide</a>.</p>'

      description: '<p>Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default or based on value of the state. You can disable a rule using <a>DisableRule</a>.</p> <p>A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated by AWS services go to your account''s default event bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or applications go to the matching partner event bus. If you have custom applications or services, you can specify whether their events go to your default event bus or a custom event bus that you have created. For more information, see <a>CreateEventBus</a>.</p> <p>If you''re updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you specify in this <code>PutRule</code> command. If you omit arguments in <code>PutRule</code>, the old values for those arguments aren''t kept. Instead, they''re replaced with null values.</p> <p>When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.</p> <p>A rule must contain at least an <code>EventPattern</code> or <code>ScheduleExpression</code>. Rules with <code>EventPatterns</code> are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with <code>ScheduleExpressions</code> self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an <code>EventPattern</code> and a <code>ScheduleExpression</code>, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule.</p> <p>When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use the <code>PutRule</code> operation and assign tags, you must have both the <code>events:PutRule</code> and <code>events:TagResource</code> permissions.</p> <p>If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the <code>PutRule</code> operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use <a>TagResource</a> and <a>UntagResource</a>.</p> <p>Most services in AWS treat <code>:</code> or <code>/</code> as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event that you want to match.</p> <p>In EventBridge, you could create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If you don''t write the rule carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.</p> <p>To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions don''t refire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change. </p> <p>An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit.

To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the <code>RunCommandParameters</code> field.</p> <p>To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge needs the appropriate permissions.

To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account''s event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when you run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event.
